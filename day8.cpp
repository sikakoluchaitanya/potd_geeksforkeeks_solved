/*Given a sorted array arr containing n elements with possibly duplicate is to find indexes of first elements, the task is to find the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
Note: If the number x is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1.


Example 1:

Input:
n=9, x=5
arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125 }
Output:  
2 5
Explanation: 
First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last occurrence of 5 is at index 5. 
Example 2:

Input:
n=9, x=7
arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125 }
Output:  
6 6
Explanation: 
First and last occurrence of 7 is at index 6.*/
